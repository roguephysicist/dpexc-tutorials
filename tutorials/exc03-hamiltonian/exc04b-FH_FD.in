exciton     # excitonic calculation (the EXC code) in transition space
exc         # full exciton calculation, requires screening file with -s option
so          # allows use of scissor correction specified by soenergy
coupling    # creates the full excitonic Hamiltonian, no longer Tamm-Dancoff
diag_para   # parallel diagonalization of the excitonic Hamiltonian using MPI

# The choice of G-shells is still possible both using npwmat or matsh
matsh 6     # number of shells of G-vectors for the \epsilon matrix
wfnsh 15    # number of shells of plane waves to describe the wavefunctions

# Another parameter to converge is the number of bands to include in the construction of \chi_0
nbands  8   # number of the last band
lomo 2      # number of the first band

# In the case of optical absorption the value of the 
# perturbation wavevector q is 0
# DP considers automatically 6 different polarization directions 
# (3 Cartesian axis and 3 reciprocal lattice vector directions)
q
0.0 0.0 0.0 # q [reduced coordinates] (if q is exactly 0 -> 6 pol)

# Frequency range of interest in eV
omegai 0.0  # initial frequency
omegae 7.0  # last frequency
domega 0.01 # delta \omega

# Broadening of the curve: it is usually advised to use a small
# broadening here (0.01 eV) and add more broadening in a second time
# using the tool "broad"
broad  0.075 # Lorentzian broadening

# Scissor operator in eV
soenergy 0.638

verboselevel 3 # this puts the verbosity level to 'high' (lowest is 0)
